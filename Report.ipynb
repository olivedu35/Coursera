Now, there is lots of data from the city of Rennes and other contractors that have business in Rennes. Like for example the company that run the bus in Rennes has some API to get datas about them. Bus stop location, real time traffic, etc..\n\nOur objectif in this project is to cluster Rennes Neighborhood using foursquare and using datas from the city of Rennes.\n\nWe use foursquare API but we also add data about transportation of Rennes city.\n\nThen we try to analyse cluster predicted and assigned them to groups of people. \n\nOverall business objectif  is to direct people/businesses, that are looking to settle in Rennes, into the good neighborhood."

We downloaded some csv files containing informations about Rennes and others cities surrounding Rennes. Each equipment, location, etc. is coming with a Latitude and a Longitude. for simplicity purpose, we will use in this study only the informations concerning Rennes. \n\nIn Rennes Open Datas Services we were also able to find on very important dataset, which is the one that cut Rennes into neighborhood.\n\nThanksfully Rennes is a quite small city compared to New York and Toronto, so we do not need to cut down the numbers of neighborhood.\n\nIn order to analyse our clusters, we also have datas about : \n- Sexe, age and nationality of population in Rennes\n- Seniority of habitants of Rennes\n\nWe will use these datas to see if our analysis is correct at the end of the project. \nWe will indeed be able to see if habitants of a neighbourhood are concording with the analysis we made about each clusters we created."

Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.\n\nI choosed to compute the distance between every point and every Neighbourhood and then assign the nearest Neighbourhood to each point.\n\nOnce this operation done for Bus stops, charger for electric vehicles, paid parking, bike supports and green roads, I just needed to merge the table with the culture equipment which already contained name of each neighbourhood, and then I only needed to present my datas in the same way that I was going to do it for the Foursquare datas. \n\nAs I was this well going on my pase, I decided to apply the machine Learning algorithm (k-mean clustering) without even getting the datas to Foursquare, in order to have a first look on the clustering. \n\nOnce that done I got datas from foursquare and was quite disapointed that there were so few datas on foursquare about Rennes.\nI then applied the k-mean clustering algorithm on it only.\n\nI finally merge both dataset and applied once again the k-mean clustering algorithm.\n\nNow that I had done all this I was now able to examine my results and to draw some conclusions."

This is quite sad but there is indeed only 100 venues that are existing for the city of Rennes on Foursquare, and the more than 4500 points of interest that are coming from the Rennes Open Data website. This is clearly the reason why clustering is the same for the dataset with and without Foursquare API datas.\n\nLet's now examine the different custers :"
